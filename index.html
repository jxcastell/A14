					       The file could be used to store information about the client. The file could<br>
					       contain information like name, birthday, address or email address. You can<br>

					        a rewarding user experience.

                             You can use it to pre-fill fields on a form.<br>
                             You can use these field to provide content that the client is interested in.<br>

                             If they don’t allow you to store information then you will have to store that<br>
                             information at your sit. You will also have to program for those situation adding<br>

					         a good tool that gets abused. Cookies, when used responsibly,<br>
